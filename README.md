Following the https://www.linkedin.com/learning/full-stack-web-development-with-flask/ tutorial everything complete but the api portion. 

This is almost the completed code of this tutorial one thing to note is that flask-restplus is now no longer maintained but flask-restx seems to work fine. Feel free to do what you want with this code.

Was just trying to understand flask
